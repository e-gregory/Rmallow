Description: An EM algorithm to fit Mallows' mixture models to full or partial
    rankings, with or without ties. The Mallows model is a distance-based
    probability model over rankings, where probability decreases exponentially
    with distance from a central (modal) ranking. This package implements
    mixture models to handle multi-modal ranking data, as described in
    Murphy and Martin (2003) <doi:10.1016/S0167-9473(02)00165-2> and
    Adkins and Fligner (1998) <doi:10.1080/03610929808832223>.
